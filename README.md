# Digital Twin Driven Flood Evacuation System

A real-time flood evacuation planning system that combines digital twin technology with Google Maps traffic data to optimize emergency response.

## About

This project implements a sophisticated flood evacuation system that:
- Simulates flood scenarios using dynamic elevation models
- Provides multiple evacuation routing algorithms
- Supports both emergency responders and citizens
- Visualizes flood impact and evacuation routes
- Includes role-based access control
- Google Maps API integration for efficient safe center finding

## Features

- 🌊 Real-time flood simulation
- 🚗 Live traffic integration with Google Maps
- 🗺️ Interactive mapping with Folium
- 🚦 Multiple evacuation algorithms:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* Search
  - Quanta Adaptive Routing
  - Bidirectional Search
- 👥 Role-based user interfaces:
  - Emergency Responder Dashboard
  - Citizen Interface
- 📊 Risk assessment and recommendations
- 🏥 Safe center identification and capacity management
- 🆘 SOS alerting and Evacuation Plan Notifications
